# express-pokemon-crud-app
This assignment is similar to the in class exercises from the week of 1/30
Now that we have done Express together, it's time for you to take some time to practice yourself!

Your repo must include:
Use LowDB as we did in class to make a db.json file to simulate a database. This will hold an array of pokemon objects. The objects should at least have a name property
One GET Route should Get all pokemon from the "database" 
One GET Route should Get one specific pokemon based on the name from the "database" 
One POST Route to create a new pokemon and add it from the "database" 
One PUT Route to edit a specific pokemon 
One DELETE Route to delete a pokemon from the "database"
Routes are separated in the routes/pokemonRoutes.js file
